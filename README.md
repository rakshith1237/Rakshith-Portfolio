# 👋 Hey, I'm Sai Rakshith — Architecting Intelligence, Not Just Models

Welcome to my portfolio — a living archive of my journey to becoming an AI/ML engineer who delivers real-world solutions, not just well-commented code.

I’m currently deep in a **68-day, full-immersion bootcamp** where I’ve committed to building not just skills, but systems. My focus? Bringing AI to the frontline of **cybersecurity, business continuity, and intelligent automation**. This isn’t coursework. This is my blueprint for entering — and excelling in — the world of applied AI.

I'm not chasing hype. I’m building a body of work that reflects mastery over:

- Machine learning systems that adapt and scale
- Rule logic engines that simulate expert reasoning
- Real-time dashboards that surface decision-ready insights
- Edge AI solutions that work even when the cloud doesn’t

## 🧭 Who I Am — Beyond the Code

In 2023, I moved to the UK with a plan: to specialize in AI/ML.  
In 2024, I laid the foundation — learning, testing, experimenting.  
In 2025, I’m executing: every day, 8 hours a day, building projects that speak louder than resumes.

My mindset: **You don’t learn AI. You build with it until it sticks.**  
My goal: To become a product-grade AI/ML engineer with a specialty in security and automation.  
My commitment: Code, test, ship, repeat — until the system works and the story is worth telling.

## 🛠️ Current Flagship Project – SentinelAI

SentinelAI is an intelligent brute force detection engine. It’s my answer to one of cybersecurity’s most common threats — executed with precision, clarity, and full AI-readiness.

**What it does:**
- Simulates real login attack behavior using synthetic logs
- Labels events using a handcrafted rulebook
- Prepares ML-ready datasets for future supervised detection
- Powers dashboards for visibility and response

**Why it matters:**
Cyber threats don’t wait for humans to respond. SentinelAI lays the groundwork for systems that do.

## 🚀 What's Coming Next

| Project | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Edge AI Defender** | A lightweight, on-device threat alert engine running on Jetson Nano |
| **BCM AI** | ML-driven insights for business continuity and incident forecasting |
| **LicenseFlow AI** | Automating enterprise license requests + approvals with predictive routing |
| **AutoML + CI/CD** | A plug-and-play ML training pipeline with testing + deployment automation |

These aren’t toy projects. They’re designed with **deployment, scalability, and business value** in mind.
